# dicegame-pig

A simple game involving dice that I created while working through Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy.

HOW IT WORKS

Two users race against each other in this turn-based game of luck with the goal of being the first to reach a total score of 75 Points! 

During each player's turn they have the option to either end their turn AND keep the points that they've earned through rolling the single 6-sided die or roll again in hopes of building up their allotment of points that they gained during the turn. 

The catch is: if you end up rolling a 1 (or a snake eye), all the points you've built up during your turn are discarded and your turn is forcefully ended.

A pure game of chance and risk-management!

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate knowledge of basic DOM manipulation and ability to understand/write basic working game logic in JavaScript. I also learnt about setting up a simple way of reseting the state of an app through the press of a clickable-button rather than having to manually refresh the page.
